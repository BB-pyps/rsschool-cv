## About myself
I decided to study programming because I don't see any development in my profession. Now programming is just a hobby for me. But I think front-end development will keep my brains from drying out and set me on a bright new path.

### Soft skills
*   diligence
*   team play
*   empathy

### Hard skills
*   HTML5
*   CSS3
*   JavaScript (basic)
*   Git/GitHub

## Code example
***Get the Middle Character***
*You are going to be given a word. Your job is to return the middle character of the word. If the word's length is odd, return the middle character. If the word's length is even, return the middle 2 characters.*
```js
function getMiddle(s)
{
  let index;
  let result;
  if( s.length === 1){                              
    result = s[0];
  }else if(s.length % 2 === 1 && s.length !== 1){
    index = Math.floor(s.length/2);
    result = s[index];
  }else{
    index = Math.floor(s.length/2);
    result = s[index-1] + s[index];
  }
  return result;
}
